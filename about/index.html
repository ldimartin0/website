            <p>My name is Luke DiMartino, I&rsquo;m a senior at Georgetown University majoring in Economics and minoring in Statistics and Government. I&rsquo;m interested in industrial organization, antitrust economics, and  econometrics. I spend a lot of time analyzing baseball data and am conversant in baseball statistics. I&rsquo;m from the San Francisco Bay Area and I currently live in Washington, DC.</p>
<p>Outside of classes, I lead the sabermetric analysis team for Georgetown Baseball Analytics. I oversee sabermetric analysts conducting statistical analysis of all dimensions of the game. I assist analysts on technical issues, build technical tools, and directly manage our databases. I also work on recruiting analysis.</p>
<p>I have also remotely coached and judged high-school debaters from California in various capacities during the pandemic, an activity I deeply enjoyed but reluctantly give up as it slowly returns to in-person. In my free time, I cook Italian food, run with the Georgetown Running Club, and follow soccer (GGMU!).</p>
<p>I write primarily about economics and data science. R is my data analysis tool of choice, but use Stata occasionally as well. I focus on practical issues of data analysis, so I tidy, visualize, and model new datasets frequently, and regularly develop simple tools to support those tasks.</p>
