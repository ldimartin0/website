            <h2 id="metropolitan-police-department-stop-data-tool">Metropolitan Police Department Stop Data Tool</h2>
<p>The Metropolitan Police Department (MPD) began releasing data after a series of lawsuits filed by ACLU-DC, Black Lives Matter DC, and Stop Police Terror Project DC. The data record logistical information, subject demographic information, frisking actions, and tickets and arrests at each stop made by a MPD officer. Coincidentally, these data are difficult to compile and messy. They are stored in multiple CSV files on MPD&rsquo;s website and the data are riddled with arbitrary special characters, inconsistencies, and varying style.</p>
<p>I developed and maintain a package, <a href="https://github.com/ldimartin0/metropdcleanR" target="_blank"><code>metropdcleanR</code></a>, that roughly acts as an API for MPD&rsquo;s data and contains functions to clean it for analysis. The package also stores the cleaned data for direct import.</p>
<h2 id="econometrics-in-r">Econometrics in R</h2>
<p>Like most undergrads, I learned econometrics, particularly modelling, in Stata. Stata&rsquo;s unified syntax and documentation make learning new tools and extending prior ones to more complex cases easy. R&rsquo;s community-driven tools have the opposite effect. There are multiple packages for every statistical model, each with its own methods, abstractions, and syntax. While high-quality specialized resources exist, general introductory and intermediate econometric textbooks are some combination of outdated or intentionally limited to base tools. That is adequate for introductory work, but since base R does not suffice for more complex models (unlike Stata, which scales up directly), it does not prepare learners well. That is all not to mention that R was not built by econometricians and makes some peculiar design choices.</p>
<p>I surveyed resources, mostly recommended by professional economists, to find great packages and resources for the simpler models I learned in econometrics (OLS, dif-in-dif, AR(p), unidimensional fixed effects, etc.) that contain functionality for more nuanced tasks, and compiled what I learned into what amounts to a <a href="https://github.com/ldimartin0/econometrics-in-r" target="_blank">guide</a> for modern econometrics in R.</p>
<p><em>Work in progress!</em></p>
